# html emails
<h3>This is a repo of different html emails created from scratch.</h3> 
<p>Some of the emails are responsive and most are optimized for gmail. In every case these are html coded emails and not simply images of information.</p>

<p>While html email syntax can be very ugly (mainly due to gmail) it can also be interesting.</p>
